# 🚦 City Traffic Optimization Using Graph-Based Techniques

### 👨‍💻 Developed by Sheikh Noor Abdullah & Sandipta Debnath  
*A project submitted for the DSA Lab Course, Department of ICE, BAUET.*

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate and optimize traffic flow in a city using graph-based techniques. We have modeled the city as a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are weighted edges based on traffic conditions. It supports both static and dynamic traffic analysis.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for minimum traffic route
- ✅ **BFS Algorithm** for shortest path by intersection count
- ✅ **Interactive Traffic Incident Simulation**
- ✅ **Road Addition, Removal & Modification**
- ✅ **Traffic Flow Visualization** with congestion hotspots
- ✅ **Time-based Rush Hour Simulation (Morning/Evening)**
- ✅ **Interactive CLI-based Demo System**

##  Visual Output

> ✔️ City road network  
> ✔️ Route comparison between Dijkstra and BFS  
> ✔️ Traffic congestion visualization  
> ✔️ Hotspot detection based on flow

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- `networkx` for graph handling  
- `matplotlib` for visualizations  
- `heapq`, `deque` for efficient algorithms  
- `colorama` for colored terminal output
